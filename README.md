# Nvidia stock analysis

### Overview
I've been interested in investing in the stock market lately. I thought doing this project might help me learn more about valuing companies and deciding what stocks to invest in. This is a short project where I analyse Nvidia stocks using past information. Some key questions that I wanted to answer in this project are:
1. What was the change in price of stock over time?
2. What was the daily, monthly, and yearly return of the stock?
3. What is the stock's moving average?
4. How much risk do we take by investing in this stock?
5. How can we predict future stock behavior?

### Description
The first few questions are easy to answer through a couple of plots. Regarding predictions of the stock, I had to read up a bit on long short-term memory networks and one-step ahead prediction via averaging. The dataset used in this analysis can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/kalilurrahman/nvidia-stock-data-latest-and-updated/version/3
